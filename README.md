Support for NeoPixel (ZIP Halo) on BBC micro:bit with C++

The MicroPython environment for the BBC micro:bit contains functionality to address NeoPixel LED strips, such as
the ZIP Halo ring. This repository is intended to make the same functionality available for programming in C++
on the yotta platform. It contains the file neopixelsend.s copied from the bbcmicrobit/micropython repository,
together with a C++ wrapper and yotta build metadata.
